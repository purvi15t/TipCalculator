## Notes
It was an overall fun learning experience and I am glad to have the pre-work concept that helps me realize that building iOS app is really interesting and you can always learn a lot. 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. I had to keep building and running the app to see the results in the simulator else one small step may let it fall apart. 
2. The xcode version keeps changing and it is always different from the forums and videos, so I had to trial and error to create/delete repository before finally figuring it out.
3. I would sometimes struggle with getting the decimal pad up when clicking on the Text Field so I would have to go to Hardware -> Keyboard and check/uncheck the keyboard connection for the decimal pad to come up. 
4. There were warnings on the auto layout and getting the developer team which I spent minutes on before realizing that it is not essential to solve for the pre-work at the moment.
